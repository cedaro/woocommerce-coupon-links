## Usage

First, you will need to [set up a coupon](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/coupon-management/) in WooCommerce. The coupon can then be applied by adding a `coupon_code` query argument to the cart URL.

`https://audiotheme.com/cart/?coupon_code=highfive`

If the cart is empty, the coupon will still be applied and visible once the user adds a product.

Probably more useful than just applying a coupon code to the URL, is appending the coupon code argument to the end of a product's "Add to Cart" URL.

`https://audiotheme.com/view/promenade/?add-to-cart=2804&coupon_code=highfive`

In the above example, a product with the id of `2804` will be added to the cart with the `highfive` coupon applied.
